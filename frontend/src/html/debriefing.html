            We would now like to tell you a little more about the study.

            Purpose of the Study:
        </h2>
        <p class="text-left my-2">
            This study examines if human impression of competence levle change with the change of weight. 
            Previous studies have shown that overweight women face more wage penalties and negative biases, 
            compared to overweight men. Thus, this current study questions if there will be differential effects on judgments of men and women 
            when weight is manipulated parametrically in a controlled experimental setting,
            We also want to explore racial differences in ratings of competence. 
        </p>

        <p class="text-left my-2">
            Here are a couple possibilities: 
            1) increased body weight will result in more more negative evaluations of competence 
            2) these negative evaluations of competence will be steeper for women
            3) there are racial differences on the perception of competence 
        </p>
