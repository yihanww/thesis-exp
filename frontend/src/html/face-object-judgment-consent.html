            <strong>Description</strong>: We are researchers at the University of
            Chicago doing a research study about how people form impressions of
            faces. In this study you will sit in front of a computer and
            rate a series of faces on different traits.
            Instructions will be provided on the computer screen as the
            experiment progresses. At the end of the study, you will be
            asked a series of debriefing and demographic questions.
            Participation should take about
            [[duration]]. Your participation is voluntary.

        <p class="text-left my-2">
            <strong>Incentives</strong>: For your participation, you will

            If you have any questions about the study,
            feel free to contact Stefan Uddenberg or the Principal Investigator,
            Alex Todorov, at stefan.uddenberg@chicagobooth.edu. MTurk does not
            allow for prorated compensation. In the event of an
            incomplete HIT, you must contact the research team and compensation
            will be determined based on what was completed and at the
            researchers' discretion. If you are on MTurk and for any reason you do not
            complete the study (e.g. technical difficulties, or a desire to stop),
            we will only be able to pay you if you send an email
            through MTurk, or by emailing the researcher, Stefan Uddenberg, at
            stefan.uddenberg@chicagobooth.edu.
