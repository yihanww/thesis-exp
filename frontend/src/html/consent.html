            <strong>Description</strong>: We are researchers at the University of
            Chicago doing a research study about how people form impressions of
            faces. In this study you will sit in front of a computer and
            rate a series of faces on different traits.
            Instructions will be provided on the computer screen as the
            experiment progresses. At the end of the study, you will be
            asked a series of debriefing and demographic questions.
            Participation should take about
            [[duration]]. Your participation is voluntary.

            we will only be able to pay you if you send an email
            through Prolific, or by emailing the researcher, Yihan Wang, at
