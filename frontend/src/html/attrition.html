                    This is an anonymous survey consisting of multiple questions. A few questions are open-ended
                    questions
                    where you need to type a few sentences or a short paragraph or two. Many MTurk workers do not like
                    answering open-ended questions and tend to quit a
                    survey once they see such questions.
                    <strong>
                        If a sizable number of people quit a survey halfway, the
                        data
                        quality of that survey would be compromised. However, our research depends on good quality
                        data.
                    </strong>
                    Thus, please make sure you do not mind
                    open-ended questions before taking this survey.
