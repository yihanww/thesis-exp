            Thank you for your participation.
            We would now like to tell you a little more about the study.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-left mt-2 mb-0">
            Purpose of the Study:
        </h2>
        <p class="text-left my-2">
            This study examines to what extent people agree upon impressions of
            unfamiliar faces. You were tasked to evaluate each face on one attribute,
            yet other participants may have been asked to use a different attribute.
            While previous studies acknowledge our ability to collectively agree upon certain traits
            regarding certain faces, this study questions how differences exist.
            For example, you may rate a particular face a 1 on a 1 to 7 scale, and when you’re asked
            to re-evaluate the same face, you may rate it a 2. Collectively, many people
            might agree that it’s about a 2.15. So what does this variation mean?
        </p>

        <p class="text-left my-2">
            Here are a couple possibilities: 1) the inconsistency is simply
            due to errors—in other words, our impressions are imprecise &amp;
            consequently so are the evaluations we make. 2) Every person has a similar,
            but genuinely different impression. This study will be informative
            about the individual differences in
            psychological research.
