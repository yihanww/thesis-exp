        <p>You are being invited to take part in a research study. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is
            important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please take the time
            to read the following information carefully. Please ask the researcher if there is anything that is not
            clear or if you need more information.</p>

        <p>This research project concerns psychological processes. The experiment will ask you to answer simple
            questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting with a Web survey. Your data will be pooled with those
            of others, and your responses will be completely anonymous. However, we will keep the data obtained for all
            participants for possible use in other scientific publications. </p>
        <p>
            We expect that this experiment will take only about <b>[[duration]]</b> and carries no foreseeable risks
            and/or
            benefits beyond any compensation that you may receive and the knowledge that you are helping to improve our
            knowledge of human psychology.</p>

        <p>
            Due to the nature of psychology experiments, we cannot explain the precise purpose of the experiment until
            after the session is over, but you will be asked to make judgements or decisions about what you see as part
            of this study. You will be given more specific instructions as you go about the tasks.</p>

        <p>
            Afterwards, the experimenter will be happy to answer any questions you might have about the procedure. You
            will receive the reward specified on the Mechanical-Turk HIT for participating. Your participation is
            completely voluntary. You are free to decline to participate or to end participation at any time for any
            reason without penalty. </p>

        <p><u><b> Confidentiality:</b></u>
            <br> All records from this study will be kept confidential. The study data will be kept in a coded manner
            (separate from your name) until the end of the study. At that time your name or other identifiable data will
            no longer be connected to any of the study data. Research records will be stored securely in a locked
            cabinet and/or on password-protected computers. The research team will be the only party that will have
            access to your data.
            <p>
                <u><b>Compensation:</b></u> <br> You will be paid [[compensation]] for [[duration]] of participation.
